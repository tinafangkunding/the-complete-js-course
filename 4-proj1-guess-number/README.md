## DOM Manipulation

What is DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model, is a structured representation of HTML documents.

DOM allows JS to access HTML elements and sytles to manipulate them.

DOM is automatically created by browser as soon as the HTML page loads, and stored as a tree structure.

DOM is not a part of JS, while DOM Methods and Properties is the WEB APIs of browsers, and can interact with JS. There are lots of other Web APIs such as timers, fetch, etc.
