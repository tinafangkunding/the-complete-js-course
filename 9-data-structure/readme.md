## 118 which data structure to use?

### 1. Sources of Data

1. From the program itself: Data written directly in source code (e.g. status message)
2. From the UI: Data input from the user or data written in DOM (e.g. tasks in todo app)
3. From external sources: Data fetched for example from web API (e.g. recipe objects)

How to decide

1. is that a simple list of value?

Yes, then use Arrays or Sets.

2. is that key/value pairs?
